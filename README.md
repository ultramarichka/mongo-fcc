## 1. INSTALL MongoDB

Hey hey from learnyoumongo. First, let's get MongoDB installed.
You can download MongoDB from https://www.mongodb.org/downloads.

We will also need to add it to your $PATH.

### HINTS

To verify that mongod is installed, you can try running mongod --version.

If you are on Windows, you will need to use mongod.exe instead.

It should print out something similar to:

    db version v2.6.8
    2015-05-06T09:44:39.362-0500 git version: nogitversion
